### 2026-06-12 · CALI-9 · webapp fix — vendor three.js locally (no CDN)
- Bug (real-use): on Theo's machine the Build button did nothing + a 404 in devtools. Cause: three.js
  was imported from the **unpkg CDN**; when that's blocked/offline/flaky the module import fails and
  `app.js` never finishes loading, so no event handlers attach. (Worked in the test browser where the
  CDN resolved — hence missed.)
- Fix: **vendor three.js locally** (`web/static/vendor/three/` — three.module.js + OrbitControls +
  STLLoader) and point the import map at local paths. App is now self-contained and works offline.
- Also: `<link rel="icon" href="data:,">` to kill the noisy favicon 404; an on-page error bar that
  shows load/runtime errors (so a dead button is never silent again); recursive package-data glob.
- Verified in-browser: zero external requests (all `localhost`), build → ALL PASS + render. 71 passed.
- Commit: 95a2e4a

### 2026-06-11 · 🎉 M2 COMPLETE · CALI-9 · webapp + SpaceMouse
- **FastAPI backend** (`server.py`): `/api/run`, `/api/refine`, `/api/runs/{id}/part.stl`,
  `/api/health` — reuse the library; persist runs; serve a no-build front end. `caliper serve` +
  `make serve`.
- **Front end** (`web/static`, no build step — three.js ESM via import map): intent box, refine box,
  measurement report panel (✓/✗ + margins + changes + clarify question), spec view, STL download, and
  a three.js viewer (STL loader + orbit, grid, lighting).
- **3Dconnexion SpaceMouse** (Theo's key ask) via **WebHID**: "Connect SpaceMouse" button →
  `navigator.hid`, 6DOF int16 axes → model rotate + camera pan/dolly, deadzone/gains tweakable, live
  axis readout, graceful fallback to mouse. Works in Chrome/Edge over localhost.
- **Verified in a real browser** (preview MCP): page loads error-free, `Build it` → ALL PASS report +
  bracket rendered in 3D; `Refine "make the holes 8mm and add a rib"` → "hole Ø 5.2 → 8.0, rib 0→1",
  re-measured, viewer reloaded the new mesh; STL downloads. Screenshotted both.
- Fixes found via the browser/test loop: FastAPI body models must be module-level under
  `from __future__ import annotations` (else 422); refine parser now handles "8mm" (no space) and
  prefers an explicit mm value over an M-size; a TDZ bug (`smOn` read before init in the render loop);
  dev `Cache-Control: no-store` so the browser never serves a stale module.
- Tests: **71 passed** (added server tests via FastAPI TestClient + refine regressions).
- Commit: 3c78fff

### 2026-06-11 · CALI-1.M1 · refine parser — per-side & word-number hole counts
- Real-use gap: "only do one hole on each side … in the middle" wasn't recognized (parser only knew
  digit + plural "N holes" as a *total*).
- Now the count parser accepts singular "hole", word-numbers ("one".."ten"), and **per-flange**
  phrasing ("on each side", "per leg") → doubles to the total. A single hole per flange is centred
  by the generator's positioning; "middle"/"centre" is acknowledged in the change list.
- Tests: **63 passed** (added 2). Verified the user's exact instruction → hole count 4 → 2,
  `bolt_pattern count=2`, ALL PASS, new STL.
- Commit: c9523c8

### 2026-06-11 · 🎉 M1 COMPLETE · CALI-1.M1 · refinement loop (one iteration cycle)
- New `refine.py`: a natural-language refinement → mutated spec. Offline deterministic parser for the
  common bracket edits (hole Ø, hole count, bolt spacing, wall, cable bore, ribs) plus an LLM path
  with offline fallback. Crucially mutates the *generator-read parameters* and re-syncs dependent
  assertions (e.g. a hole-Ø change updates both `hole_d` and the `bolt_pattern` assertion), so the
  change flows to the mesh, not just the acceptance text.
- Wired hole geometry into the generator: `BracketParams.from_spec` now reads `hole_d`/`hole_count`;
  intake emits them as parameters. (Backward compatible — defaults unchanged.)
- CLI: `caliper refine <run-dir|spec> "<instruction>"` loads a prior run, applies the change, re-runs
  the loop, emits a new run/STL. `_run_and_emit` shared with `run`. `make refine` target added.
- Demo: `run` → 4×Ø5.2; `refine "make the holes 8 mm"` → `bolt_pattern` re-synced to diameter=8.0,
  ALL PASS, new STL whose bytes differ (geometry changed; same triangle count). Optimizer tune
  already lived in the loop (CALI-6/7), so this completes the M1 "one NL refinement + one tune" cycle.
- Tests: **61 passed** (M1 added 14, incl. an OCCT end-to-end proving the rebuilt part has 4×Ø8 holes).
- Commits: `f78da23` (refinement loop), `cd857a4` (`make refine` target).

### 2026-06-11 · CALI-0 · canonical OCCT env via micromamba (Plan B) + zero-activation workflow
- Anaconda's classic solver stalled 55+ min on cadquery. Switched to standalone **micromamba**
  (osx-arm64), which solved + built the env in <1 min at `/opt/anaconda3/envs/caliper`:
  **cadquery 2.7.0 / occt 7.8.1 / ocp 7.8.1.2 / python 3.11**. Then `pip install -r requirements-pip.txt`.
- cadquery 2.7 dropped the `nptyping` dep → no numpy shim needed (unlike the pip-2.4 scratch venv).
- **`make test` → 47 passed** in the canonical env (auto-resolves the prefix), confirming the code
  works on cadquery 2.7 (not just the 2.4 used for the earlier scratch verification). CLI run → STL ✓.
- Editable-installed the package (`caliper` command) and added `make install`/`make run` targets that
  resolve the env python directly — no shell activation needed. Updated README/environment.yml to
  recommend the micromamba recipe.
- Commits: `e999d31` (micromamba env), `2c64680` (make targets + zero-activation docs).

### 2026-06-11 · 🎉 M0 COMPLETE · CALI-2/4/8 verified end-to-end with real geometry
- Verified the OCCT-dependent path. Fixed a generator bug: the CadQuery `"XZ"` plane normal is
  `(0,-1,0)`, so `extrude` is sign-defined and left the body off-centre on Y (bolt holes landed at
  the flange edge). Now recentre from the actual bounding box.
- **CALI-4** generator confirmed: corner bracket builds watertight, one body, 4×Ø5.2 holes on the
  bolt circle, optional Ø10 cable bore.
- **CALI-2** B-rep hole detection + `holes_matching(on=circle(60), count=4)` confirmed.
- **CALI-8** `caliper run "...four M5 holes and a cable pass-through" --no-llm --yes` → draft spec →
  clarify gate → loop → **ALL PASS** (bbox [60,20,60], min_wall 2.99, 4×Ø5.2 ✓, mass 8.1 g,
  watertight 1 body, bore Ø10) → 128 KB `runs/run_0000/part.stl`.
- **Full suite: 47 passed.** Verified in a pip CadQuery scratch venv (numpy-2 alias shim for the
  abandoned `nptyping`) because the conda env was still solving; re-confirmed later in the conda env.
- Commit: `ff8e154`.

### 2026-06-11 · CALI-6, CALI-7, CALI-8 · loop controller, decide, CLI
- **CALI-7** decide: continuous route (1-D grid+refine optimizer over a continuous param, scored by
  all_pass/pass-count/margin) and a structural route (bump a discrete param); defers to LLM when
  neither applies. Verified: a mass-over-budget failure is fixed by tuning `wall`.
- **CALI-6** loop controller: generate→build→sense→evaluate→decide with iteration cap, oscillation
  detection, run persistence (`runs/<id>/` spec+report+STL). Verified: converges, caps, detects
  oscillation, surfaces build failures. Injected `eval_fn` keeps it kernel-free for tests.
- **CALI-8** CLI: `caliper run "<intent>"` one-shot; `--no-llm`/`--yes` for reproducible runs; the
  ask-don't-assume clarify gate blocks non-interactive builds. Gate verified; end-to-end smoke
  (real STL) is OCCT-gated.
- Whole suite: **39 passed, 4 skipped** (CadQuery-only) in a clean venv.
- Commit: `a223b13`.

### 2026-06-11 · CALI-1, CALI-3, CALI-5 verified; CALI-2, CALI-4 written
- **CALI-1** spec schema: pydantic models (continuous/discrete/fixed params, references, machine stub,
  assertions under the `assert` alias); lossless YAML/JSON round-trip; validation on bad input.
- **CALI-3** evaluator: safe AST interpreter (no `eval`), signed margins for comparisons, compound
  `and` reports the binding margin, deferred probes (e.g. `interference`) marked `deferred` not failed.
- **CALI-5** intake: deterministic offline drafting for the bracket family (parses size, hole spec,
  extrusion width, cable), ask-don't-assume clarify gate, LLM path with offline fallback.
- **CALI-2** measurement API: mesh side verified (bbox, volume, mass, watertight, body_count, ray-cast
  `min_wall_thickness`, deferred probes); B-rep hole detection written, OCCT-gated.
- **CALI-4** corner-bracket CadQuery generator written (L-profile extrude, per-leg bolt holes, optional
  ribs + cable bore, structured build-error capture); OCCT-gated.
- Tests: **29 passed, 3 skipped** (CadQuery-only) in a throwaway venv. Added `rtree` dependency
  (trimesh ray casting needs it for `min_wall_thickness`).
- Commit: `0d93efa`.

### 2026-06-11 · CALI-0 · project scaffolding + environment
- Initialized local git repo. Created `src/caliper/` package layout, `tests/`, `pm/`, `nightshift/`.
- Stood up the .md PM system: `BOARD.md`, `TASKS.md`, `LOG.md`, `pm/README.md`.
- Adopted ai-night-shift conventions locally (loop/review/test guard) without cron — see `nightshift/`.
- Env: moved all non-OCCT deps to a pip layer (`requirements-pip.txt`) so conda only resolves
  `cadquery` under strict conda-forge priority (the full mixed-channel solve stalled).
- Decisions: conda for the env; nightshift conventions-only (no autonomous cron yet); start M0 core.
- Commits: `aa00b5d` (scaffolding + M0 skeleton), `45cd6b9` (lean conda env).
