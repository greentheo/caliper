### 2026-06-11 · CALI-0 · project scaffolding + environment
- Initialized local git repo. Created `src/caliper/` package layout, `tests/`, `pm/`, `nightshift/`.
- Stood up the .md PM system: `BOARD.md`, `TASKS.md`, `LOG.md`, `pm/README.md`.
- Adopted ai-night-shift conventions locally (loop/review/test guard) without cron — see `nightshift/`.
- Env: moved all non-OCCT deps to a pip layer (`requirements-pip.txt`) so conda only resolves
  `cadquery` under strict conda-forge priority (the full mixed-channel solve stalled).
- Decisions: conda for the env; nightshift conventions-only (no autonomous cron yet); start M0 core.
- Commits: `aa00b5d` (scaffolding + M0 skeleton), `45cd6b9` (lean conda env).
