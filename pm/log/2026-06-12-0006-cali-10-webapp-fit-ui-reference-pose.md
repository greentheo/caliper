### 2026-06-12 · CALI-10 · Webapp fit UI + reference pose (in-3D placement)
- **Why:** fit was computed in baked coordinates — the reference had no pose, so it only "worked"
  because the demo obstacle STL was hand-authored in the bracket's frame. Real STLs (centered on their
  own origin) would land on top of the part. Fix: give references a **pose** and let you set it in 3D.
- **Reference pose:** `Reference` gains `position` (mm) + `rotation` (deg, three.js XYZ euler).
  `measure.pose_matrix` (scipy `XYZ` intrinsic, matches three.js) + `Geometry.from_stl_posed` bake the
  pose at load, so the fit probes stay pose-agnostic and the measured pose == what you see.
- **Backend:** `POST /api/fit` (base64 reference STL + pose + clearance/no-overlap + optional `free`
  param) → attaches a posed reference, promotes a size param, runs the loop, persists. Reference STL is
  copied into the run dir + recorded in `meta.references` (pose + serve url); served at
  `/api/runs/{id}/ref/{ref_id}.stl`; `get_run` returns references so a reloaded fit re-renders. Shared
  fit logic factored into `caliper/fit.py` (used by CLI + server; CLI `_cmd_fit` refactored onto it).
- **Front end (no-build):** vendored `TransformControls` (r160). Import an STL → renders
  **semi-transparent** with a move/rotate **gizmo** (W/E keys, mode buttons) → **Fit** reads the pose,
  POSTs, swaps in the resized part. The viewer now renders the part in its **true build frame** (no
  `geom.center()`) and frames on the combined part+reference bbox, so both share one coordinate system.
  Loading a past fit run re-renders its reference at the stored pose.
- **Verified in a real browser (Preview MCP):** build → import a box STL (gizmo appears) → Fit → server
  resizes + re-renders; loaded run_0026 shows the blue bracket pulled back from the orange reference at
  `[52,0,2]` with ALL PASS and `min_clearance(obstacle) actual=3`. No console errors.
- **Known caveat:** `/api/fit` is synchronous; a *coincident full-bracket* reference took ~30s (many
  mesh booleans × optimizer samples). A simple obstacle box is seconds. Logged as a follow-up.
- Tests: `tests/test_server.py` fit end-to-end + 404 (now **92 passed**). Commit: 6f048a8
