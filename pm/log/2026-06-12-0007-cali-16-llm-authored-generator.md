### 2026-06-12 · CALI-16 · LLM-authored generator (the spec's primary strategy)
- **Why:** the MVP shipped one hardcoded part family; the LLM only drafted a spec. The design spec's
  headline generation strategy (§2) is an **LLM-authored parametric script**. This builds it — the
  difference between "a bracket parameter optimizer" and the measurement-grounded vibe-CAD loop.
- **Sandbox** (`sandbox.py` + `_sandbox_runner.py`): authored scripts run in a **subprocess** (timeout,
  temp cwd), export **STEP** (keeps the B-rep so hole/face probes survive the process boundary), parent
  re-imports → `Geometry`. Any failure → structured `{error, traceback}` (the "stack trace" channel).
  Local-trust threat model; a hard sandbox (container/net-cutoff) is logged for untrusted use.
- **Author** (`authoring.py`): spec → `build(params)` script; on build error, retry with the traceback
  (bounded). The LLM call is **injectable** so author+heal is fully tested without a key.
- **CLI/wiring:** `caliper gen "<intent>"` / `make gen` — intake → author → build (self-heal) → measure
  → report → persist, storing `part.py` (the human-editable source of truth). Bracket path untouched.
- **Verified live** (claude-sonnet-4-6): `gen "a cylindrical desk cable grommet, 40mm OD, 30mm bore,
  25mm tall, 5mm flange"` → the LLM wrote a real hollow **tube + flange union** (with reasoning
  comments), built on attempt 1, watertight, correct OD/height/printable walls, **7/8 asserts pass**.
  The 1 fail is a measurement nuance (`largest_through_bore` counts the tube's outer wall as a bore →
  CALI-18), not an authoring miss.
- **Two LLM-intake bugs fixed along the way** (intake/refine had been silently dead for this model):
  (1) the **assistant-prefill** trick (`{`) made `claude-sonnet-4-6` 400 → always fell back to the
  offline bracket; removed it. (2) **schema-laxness** — model drafts didn't match the schema; added a
  precise schema+vocabulary prompt and `normalize_spec_dict()` (tolerant coercion). Now `gen` produces a
  faithful `desk_cable_grommet` spec, not a bracket.
- Tests: `test_sandbox.py` (5) + `test_authoring.py` (6) + CLI gen wiring + intake-normalize. **105
  passed.** Commit: c44403a
