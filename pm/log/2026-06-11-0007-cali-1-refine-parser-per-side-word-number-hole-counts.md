### 2026-06-11 · CALI-1.M1 · refine parser — per-side & word-number hole counts
- Real-use gap: "only do one hole on each side … in the middle" wasn't recognized (parser only knew
  digit + plural "N holes" as a *total*).
- Now the count parser accepts singular "hole", word-numbers ("one".."ten"), and **per-flange**
  phrasing ("on each side", "per leg") → doubles to the total. A single hole per flange is centred
  by the generator's positioning; "middle"/"centre" is acknowledged in the change list.
- Tests: **63 passed** (added 2). Verified the user's exact instruction → hole count 4 → 2,
  `bolt_pattern count=2`, ALL PASS, new STL.
