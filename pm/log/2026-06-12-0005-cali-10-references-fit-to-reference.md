- **Measurements (real now, no longer deferred):** `measure.interference(g, ref)` → overlap volume in
  mm³ via a robust mesh boolean (manifold3d), with an AABB short-circuit and a containment-sampling
  fallback if the boolean kernel is missing; `measure.min_clearance(g, ref)` → signed gap in mm
  (positive = thinnest air gap from surface-proximity sampling, negative = deepest penetration). Both
  operate on meshes so they work directly on imported STL references. A `_as_mesh` coercer accepts a
  `Geometry`, a raw mesh, or a wrapper.
- **Reference binding:** `evaluate.load_references(spec, base_dir)` loads each `role: fixed` STL into a
  `Geometry`; `build_context`/`evaluate` take a `references=` map and bind `interference`/`min_clearance`
  to the real geometry. An *unloaded* reference resolves to an opaque handle so a fit check errors
  loudly instead of silently passing. `loop.make_eval_fn(references=…)` loads once and caches.
- **Snug fit:** `decide` auto-routes any failing `interference`/`min_clearance` assertion to a size
  parameter (`FIT_PARAM_PREFERENCE`), no per-spec id wiring. `tune_continuous(prefer=…)` adds a
  minimal-change objective: among feasible candidates pick the one closest to the original size, so the
  part shrinks *just enough* to clear (not down to the floor).
- **CLI/UX:** `caliper fit SOURCE --ref ID=FILE.stl [--min-clearance MM] [--no-overlap] [--free PARAM]`
  attaches the reference + fit assertion(s), promotes a fixed size param to a continuous range, runs the
  loop, persists a new run. Defaults to no-collision if no constraint given. `make fit`. Demo fixture
  `examples/obstacle.stl` (+ `make_obstacle.py`); `.gitignore` keeps `examples/**/*.stl`.
- **Verified end-to-end:** 60mm bracket vs a block at x∈[42,62] → fit shrinks the leg to 39mm for a
  clean ≥2mm clearance (`min-clearance 2`), or to 42mm just-touching for no-overlap. Tests:
  `tests/test_references.py` (11) + 2 CLI fit tests; updated the two evaluator/measure tests that
  assumed deferral. Full suite **90 passed**.
